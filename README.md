# NSS Exercise: Tuples

### Description:
Work with tuples in Python

## Instructions

1. Create a tuple named `zoo` that contains your favorite animals.
1. Find one of your animals using the `.index(value)` method on the tuple.
1. Determine if an animal is in your tuple by using `for value in tuple`.
1. Create a variable for each of the animals in your tuple with this cool feature of Python.

    ```
    # example
    (lizard, fox, mammoth) = zoo
    print(lizard)
    ```

1. Convert your tuple into a list.
1. Use `extend()` to add three more animals to your zoo.
1. Convert the list back into a tuple.

### How to run in terminal (Python3 used):
```
git clone https://github.com/Megraohoh/tuples
cd tuples
python zoo.py

```
